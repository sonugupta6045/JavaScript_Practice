# javascript and classes
// javascript is a prototype based language
## oop 

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use oop
- code reusability
- easier maintenance
- better organization
- encapsulation
- inheritance

## part of oop
Object literal
- a way to create an object using a simple syntax
 - Constructor function
 - Prototype
 - Classes
 - Instances (new, this)

 ## 4 pillars of OOP
- Encapsulation
  - bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit
  - hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods
- Abstraction
  - simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have
  - exposing only the necessary parts of an object while hiding the implementation details
- Inheritance
  - allowing a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class
  - promoting code reusability and establishing a natural hierarchy between classes
- Polymorphism
  - enabling objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass
  - allowing methods to be defined in a way that they can operate on objects of different types
