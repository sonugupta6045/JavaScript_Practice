 function fetchData() {
    // async function
}

synchronous and single threaded function are by default blocking

execution context is the environment in which the code is executed

execcute one line of code at a time

blocking code is code that prevents the execution of other code until it is finished
non blocking code is code that allows other code to run while it is executing
function fetchData() {
    // Simulating a blocking operation
    console.log("Fetching data...");
    for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {} // Simulate a delay
    console.log("Data fetched.");
}

used of the blocking and non blocking code are depend on the use case
// blocking code are those code when first completed thier task then goes for another one.
